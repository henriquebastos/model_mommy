# Creating objects for testing shouldn't hurt

model_mommy is a tool for creating objects for testing in Django, inspired in ruby's ObjectDaddy and FactoryGirl.
It generate the values according with the field type, but i will add support to custom values as well.


# Installing

```console
pip install model_mommy
```

## Basic Usage:

If you have a model like this in your app:

```python
class Kid(models.Model):
    happy = models.BooleanField()
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    bio = models.TextField()
    wanted_games_qtd = models.BigIntegerField()
    birthday = models.DateField()
    appointment = models.DateTimeField()
```

just call the mommy =):

```python
from model_mommy import mommy
from model_mommy.models import Kid

kid = mommy.make_one(Kid)
```

and your object is created! No boring attributes passing like 'foobar' every damn time.

Import every model you need can be very boring, so, you can also call mommy using a string like this:

```python
kid = mommy.make_one('model_mommy.Kid')
```
Note that you must use 'app_label.model_name'. The model_name is case insensitive.

mommy also handles relationships. Suppose the kid has a dog:

```python
class Dog(models.Model):
    owner = models.ForeignKey('Kid')
```

when you do:

```python
rex = mommy.make_one(Dog)
```

it will also create the Kid, automatically.

You can also specify values for one or more attribute.

```python
another_kid = mommy.make_one(Kid, age = 3)
assert another_kid.age == 3
```

With relationships with ForeignKey fields, you can also set the related objects attributes like this:

```python
bobs_dog = mommy.make_one(Dog, owner__name='Bob')
```

But, if don't need a persisted object, mommy can handle this for you as well:

```python
from model_mommy import mommy
from model_mommy.models import Kid

kid = mommy.prepare_one(Kid)
```

It works like make_one, but like was said, it doesn't persist the instance.

## How mommy behaves?

model_mommy skips fields with null=True or blank=True. Also if the field has a default value, mommy will use it.

## When you shouldn't let mommy do the things for you:

If you have a field that has any special validation, you should set the value by yourself.
model_mommy should be used to handle the fields that doesn't have relation with the test that you're doing at the moment and don't require special validation(like unique, etc), but still required in order to create the object.

###Currently supports the fields:
BooleanField, IntegerField, BigIntegerField, SmallIntegerField, PositiveIntegerField, PositiveSmallIntegerField, FloatField, DecimalField, CharField, TextField, SlugField, ForeignKey, OneToOneField, ManyToManyField, DateField, DateTimeField, TimeField, URLField, EmailField, FileField and ImageField.

## Recipes
If you're not confortable with random data, or you have some custom fields, or even you just want to improve the semantics of data generation, there's hope for you.
You can define a recipe, which is a set of rules to generate data for your models. You create a module called mommy_recipes.py at the app root:

```python
from model_mommy.recipe import Recipe

person = Recipe(Person,
    name = 'John Doe',
    nickname = 'joe',
    age = 18,
    birthday = date.today(),
    appointment = datetime.now()
)
```

The variable 'person' serves as the recipe name, which will be used for data creation when you call:

```python
from model_mommy import mommy
mommy.make_recipe('model_mommy.person')
```

Or if you don't want a persisted model:

```python
mommy.prepare_recipe('model_mommy.person')
```

Where 'model_mommy' is the app name and 'person' is the recipe name

### ForeignKeys

You can also define foreign_key relations:

```python
dog = Recipe(Dog,
    breed = 'Pug',
    owner = foreign_key(person)
)
```

Notice that 'person' is a recipe. You may be thinking: "I can put the Person model instance directly in the owner field": And yes, you can. But i recommend using the foreign_key function for 2 reasons:

  * Semantics: You know it's an foreign_key relation when you're reading
  * The associated model will be created only when you call 'make_recipe' and not during recipe definition

### Passing Callables

You can also pass callables as arguments, so that the values will be generated during 'make_recipe':

```python
callable = date.today
person = Recipe(Person,
    name = 'John Doe',
    nickname = 'joe',
    age = 18,
    birthday = callable,
)
```

### Overriding recipe definitions
You can have different values when calling **make_recipe** or **prepare_recipe**. This is useful when you have to create multiple objects and you have some unique field, for instance. You just have to pass the values as keyword args, like this:

```python
mommy.make_recipe('model_mommy.person', name='Peter Parker')
```

# Hacking

### 1. prepare a virtual environment

```console
pip install virtualenvwrapper
mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute
```

### 2. install the requirements

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. run the tests

```console
tox
```
