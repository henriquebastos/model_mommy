Model Mommy: Smart fixtures for better tests
============================================

*Model-mommy* offers you a smart way to create fixtures for testing in Django.
With a simple and powerful API you can create many objects with a single line of code.

Install
=======

.. code-block:: console

    pip install model_mommy


Basic usage
===========

Let's say you have an app **family** with a model like this:

.. code-block:: python

    class Kid(models.Model):
        happy = models.BooleanField()
        name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        age = models.IntegerField()
        bio = models.TextField()
        wanted_games_qtd = models.BigIntegerField()
        birthday = models.DateField()
        appointment = models.DateTimeField()

To create a persisted instance, just call *Mommy*:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy
    from family.models import Kid

    kid = mommy.make_one(Kid)

No need to pass attributes every damn time.

Importing every model over and over again is boring. So let *Mommy* import them for you:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    kid = mommy.make_one('family.Kid')

Note that you must use `app_label.model_name`. The `model_name` is case insensitive.


Model Relationships
-------------------

*Mommy* also handles relationships. Say the kid has a dog:

.. code-block:: python

    class Dog(models.Model):
        owner = models.ForeignKey('Kid')

when you ask *Mommy*:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    rex = mommy.make_one('family.Dog')

She will also create the `Kid`, automagically.


Defining some attributes
------------------------

Of course it's possible to explicitly set values for attributes.

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    another_kid = mommy.make_one('family.Kid', age=3)

Related objects attributes are also reachable:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    bobs_dog = mommy.make_one('family.Dog', owner__name='Bob')


Non persistent objects
----------------------

If don't need a persisted object, *Mommy* can handle this for you as well:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    kid = mommy.prepare_one('family.Kid')

It works like `make_one`, but it doesn't persist the instance.


How mommy behaves?
==================

By default, *model-mommy* skips fields with `null=True` or `blank=True`. Also if a field has a *default* value, it will be used.

You can override this behavior by explicitly defining values.


When shouldn't you let mommy generate things for you?
-----------------------------------------------------

If you have fields with special validation, you should set their values by yourself.

*Model-mommy* should handle fields that:

1. don't matter for the test you're writing;
2. don't require special validation (like unique, etc);
3. are required to create the object.


Currently supported fields
--------------------------

* BooleanField, IntegerField, BigIntegerField, SmallIntegerField, PositiveIntegerField, PositiveSmallIntegerField, FloatField, DecimalField
* CharField, TextField, SlugField, URLField, EmailField
* ForeignKey, OneToOneField, ManyToManyField
* DateField, DateTimeField, TimeField
* FileField, ImageField


Recipes
=======

If you're not confortable with random data, or you have some custom fields, or even you just want to improve the semantics of the generated data, there's hope for you.

You can define a **recipe**, which is a set of rules to generate data for your models. Create a module called `mommy_recipes.py` at your app's root directory:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy.recipe import Recipe
    from family.models import Person

    person = Recipe(Person,
        name = 'John Doe',
        nickname = 'joe',
        age = 18,
        birthday = date.today(),
        appointment = datetime.now()
    )

The variable `person` serves as the recipe name:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    mommy.make_recipe('family.person')

Or if you don't want a persisted instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    mommy.prepare_recipe('family.person')


Recipes with foreign keys
-------------------------

You can define `foreign_key` relations:

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy
    from model_mommy.recipe import Recipe, foreign_key
    from family.models import Person, Dog


    person = Recipe(Person,
        name = 'John Doe',
        nickname = 'joe',
        age = 18,
        birthday = date.today(),
        appointment = datetime.now()
    )

    dog = Recipe(Dog,
        breed = 'Pug',
        owner = foreign_key(person)
    )

Notice that `person` is a *recipe*.

You may be thinking: "I can put the Person model instance directly in the owner field". That's not recommended.

Using the `foreign_key` is important for 2 reasons:

* Semantics. You'll know that attribute is a foreign key when you're reading;
* The associated instance will be created only when you call `make_recipe` and not during recipe definition;


Recipes with callables
----------------------

It's possible to use *callables* as recipe's attribute value.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import date
    from model_mommy.recipe import Recipe
    from family.models import Person

    person = Recipe(Person,
        birthday = date.today,
    )

When you call `make_recipe`, *Mommy* will set the attribute to the value returned by the callable.


Overriding recipe definitions
-----------------------------

Passing values when calling `make_recipe` or `prepare_recipe` will override the recipe rule.

.. code-block:: python

    from model_mommy import mommy

    mommy.make_recipe('model_mommy.person', name='Peter Parker')

This is useful when you have to create multiple objects and you have some unique field, for instance.

Inspiration
===========

*Model-mommy* was inspired by many great open source software like ruby's ObjectDaddy and FactoryGirl.
